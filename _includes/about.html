        <p>BSides Oslo is a independent, community-driven inclusive information security conference. A part of the global Security BSides network, the conference creates a space for members of the information security community to come together and share their knowledge and experiences. BSides Oslo is intended for anyone working with, studying with or is interested in security.</p>

	<p>The first annual BSides Oslo was held in <a href="https://2019.bsidesoslo.no">2019</a>. Despite our best efforts, BSides 2020 needed to be postponed to 2021 due to Covid-19. BSides 2021 will be held on {{ site.date }}, at {{ site.location }}.</p>
        <p>BSides Oslo is a non-profit conference, and there are still some sponsor opportunities. For more information, please review <a href="/#sponsors">the sponsorship section</a>.
